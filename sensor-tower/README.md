This is a real problem we've encountered in our work with games and studios. Our company database sometimes contains multiple entries for the same organization due to inconsistent naming. These variations can be caused by regional branding, abbreviations, typos, or alternate naming conventions.

For example, these may all refer to the same company:

"Ubisoft Montreal"

"Ubisoft Montréal Studio"

"Ubisoft Canada"

The Challenge
Write a program using TypeScript that takes as input a text file of company names and outputs potential duplicates which likely refer to the same company.

We're not expecting a perfect solution. Some cases are inherently ambiguous (e.g., "Sony Santa Monica" vs. "Santa Monica Studio"). We're very much looking for a "good enough" solution. False positives (and false negatives) are inevitable.

Your code should be documented, readable, and maintainable - such that you'd be comfortable committing it to a shared public repository. We ask that you don’t spend more than 60-90 minutes on this as we understand your personal time is valuable. Accordingly, please also provide us a few thoughts on what you would do next if given more time.

Feel free to use any tools you would normally use; however, you will be assessed on your code in the next coding interview, and you'll need to be able to explain every part of it and the reasoning behind your approach.

Our Evaluation Criteria
50% : The actual problem solution (we'll look at the quality of the output)
50% : Code quality (keep it simple and readable)
